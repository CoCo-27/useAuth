# Contributing to useAuth

All contributions welcome ❤️ Bugs, docs, PRs with new features. We want it all. Project follows the [All Contributors](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/bot/usage) spec.

Most needed contributions right now:

- **more examples** Using `useAuth` in a cool new way, with a different router, or React framework? Consider contributing an example project

- **more auth providers** Right now `useAuth` only supports Auth0 and we'd love to support other providers. Perhaps even a way to use your own custom-built auth provider, that would be cool.
