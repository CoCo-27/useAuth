## 3. Create the callback page


Auth0 and most other authentication providers use OAuth. That requires redirecting your user to their login form. After login, the provider redirects the user back to your app.

Any way of creating React pages should work, here's what I use for Gatsby:

```jsx
import React, { useEffect } from "react"
import { useAuth } from "react-use-auth"
import Layout from "../components/layout"

const Auth0CallbackPage = () = {
    const { handleAuthentication } = useAuth()
    useEffect(() => {
        handleAuthentication()
    }, [])

    return (
        <Layout>
          <h1>
            This is the auth callback page, 
            you should be redirected immediately!
          </h1>
        </Layout>
    )
}

export default Auth0CallbackPage
```

The goal is to load a page, briefly show some text, and run the ```handleAuthentication``` method from useAuthon page load.

That method will create a cookie in local storage with your user's information and redirect back to homepage. Redirecting to other post-login pages currently isn't supported but is a good idea now that I thought of it ðŸ¤”

PS: Make sure you add ```domain/auth0_callback``` as a valid callback URL in your Auth0 config
