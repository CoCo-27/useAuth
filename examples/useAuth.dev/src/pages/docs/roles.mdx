# Role/scope-based permissions

[`useAuth`](https://useauth.dev) comes with built-in support for authorization.

Authorization is handy when you have different types of authenticated users. Admins are a common example. Or trial and paid users.

Debate rages whether role-based or scope-based permissions are The One True Scalable Way. `useAuth` doesn't care. There is no technical difference between roles and scopes, they're both a string you attach to the user ðŸ™ƒ

## 1. Attach roles or scopes to users

Roles and scopes are part of user data. They come from your auth provider. Every provider handles it differently.

-   [Add roles or scopes with Auth0](/docs/roles-auth0)
-   [Add roles with Netlify Identity](/docs/roles-netlify-identity)

## 2. Check user permissions

`useAuth`'s abstraction layer handles reading the correct properties for you.

To check for a single role or scope, use the `isAuthorized` method with a string.

```jsx
function AuthorizedComponent() {
    const { isAuthorized } = useAuth();

    // verify user is an admin
    if (isAuthorized("admin")) {
        return <AdminUI />;
    } else {
        return null;
    }
}
```

`isAuthorized` verifies that the user is authenticated and that their role or scope meta data contains the `"admin"` string.

To check for multiple roles, you can pass an array.

```jsx
function AuthorizedComponent() {
    const { isAuthorized } = useAuth();

    // verify user has at least 1 of these scopes
    if (isAuthorized(["moderate", "admin"])) {
        return <ModeratorUI />;
    } else {
        return null;
    }
}
```

`isAuthorized` checks for _some_ roles or scopes matching your user. If you need to check for _every_ role, run `isAuthorized` multiple times. The OR case seemed more common when designing this API :)
