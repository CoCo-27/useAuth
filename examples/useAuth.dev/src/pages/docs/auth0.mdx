# Use with Auth0

full docs coming soon

example app: [examples/useauth-gatsby-auth0](https://github.com/Swizec/useAuth/tree/master/examples/useauth-gatsby-auth0)

### Default Auth0 params

By default `useAuth`'s Auth0 client uses these params:

```jsx
const params = {
    domain: auth0_domain,
    clientID: auth0_client_id,
    redirectUri: `${callback_domain}/auth0_callback`,
    audience: `https://${auth0_domain}/api/v2/`,
    responseType: "token id_token",
    scope: "openid profile email"
};
```

`domain` and `clientID` come from your props.

`redirectUri` is set to use the `auth0_callbackpage` on the current domain. Auth0 redirects here after users login so you can set cookies and stuff. useAuthwill handle this for you ✌️

`audience` is set to use api/v2. I know this is necessary but honestly have been copypasting it through several of my projects.

`responseType` same here. I copy paste this from old projects so I figured it's a good default.

`scope` you need openid for social logins and to be able to fetch user profiles after authentication. Profile and Email too. You can add more via the `auth0_params` override.
